              Norev is a French manufacturer of die-cast scale model cars. traditionally based in Villeurbanne, a suburb of Lyon. It has normally produced modern and vintage European vehicles, especially those of French origin – though Italian, German, British, and American vehicles were also produced. Norev's closest competition was Solido, but that company had more pan-European influence, while Norev was more national in orientation.

              Norev plastic models were known for their bright body colors and their red (sometimes black) plastic hubs with white tires. Some of the attention to detail is notable, such as with the Citroën DS sedan. For instance, on the real car, the roof section is a separate plastic piece. The Norev toy also made the roof a separate plastic section, allowing for a greater variety of color combinations. In addition to this, Norev released all 3 versions of the DS19: the initial version launched in 1956, the first facelift with metal hood vents to aid cooling, released in 1961, and the second facelift in 1963, where the hood vents were replaced with holes under the headlights. Unfortunately, the Rhodialite plastic used in the models was prone to fading and warping after excessive exposure to sunlight.
