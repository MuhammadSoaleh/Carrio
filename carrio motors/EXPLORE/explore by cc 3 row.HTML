          The Honda Civic  is a series of automobiles manufactured by Honda since 1972. Since 2000, the Civic has been categorized as a compact car, while previously it occupied the subcompact class. As of 2021, the Civic is positioned between the Honda Fit/City and Honda Accord in Honda's global car line-up.
          The first-generation Civic was introduced in July 1972 as a two-door coupe model,[2] followed by a three-door hatchback that September. With a 1,169 cc transverse engine and front-wheel drive like the British Mini, the car provided good interior space despite overall small dimensions.[3] Initially gaining a reputation for being fuel-efficient, reliable and environmentally friendly, later iterations have become known for performance and sportiness, especially the Civic Type R, Civic VTi, Civic GTi and Civic SiR/Si.[4][5]

          A dry-sumped 5.2-liter V-10 is nestled behind the Huracán's cabin, and it exudes a devilish sound whenever it revs towards its 8500-rpm redline. The engine now develops 631 horsepower across all trim levels since the rear-wheel wheel drive Evo models have been dropped; those were rated at 602 horsepower. Every Huracán V-10 is paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic that snaps off shifts under its own volition or at the driver’s command via a set of paddle shifters. The all-wheel-drive Evo coupe we tested for the 2020 model year ripped from zero to 60 mph in 2.5 seconds and cleared the quarter-mile in 10.4 seconds at 135 mph. We also enjoyed a test drive in the convertible Evo Spyder, which proved high performance is always more enjoyable with a bit of theater. Every Huracán model now comes standard with rear-wheel steering which improves agility even further. Plus, it has a predictive system (called LDVI) that adapts to driver inputs on the fly. While we were mightily impressed with the new Tecnica’s communicative chassis and good ride, its steering feedback isn’t particularly vivid at normal road speeds. (The STO’s is.) Still, the Tecnica proved to be a thrilling road-eater that remains impressive on the track when pushed hard.

          The Lamborghini Huracán line sees the addition of the Tecnica model for 2023, which offers a road-friendly dose of the tantalizing tactility offered by the hardcore STO track-killer variant but at a more palatable price point. Make that relatively palatable price point. It has the same 631-horsepower output from its 5.2-liter V-10 as the mighty STO along with rear-wheel steering and a torque vectoring rear differential. The automaker has also decided to axe the rear-wheel drive versions of the Evo coupe and Spyder, which are now both offered exclusively in an all-wheel drive configuration for 2023.

        <p>The MC20 Coupé and Cielo are both powered by a twin-turbocharged V-6 engine that pumps out 621 hp. Called Nettuno, the engine utilizes a unique twin-combustion system borrowed from Formula 1 race cars and is paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. Its 207.6 horsepower per liter makes it more power-dense than any engine from other high-end supercar makers like Lamborghini, Ferrari, McLaren, or Porsche. In our testing, the MC20 needed just 3.2 seconds to reach 60 mph and shot through the quarter-mile in 11.0 seconds at 131 mph. In addition to blisteringly quick acceleration, the MC20's handling is race-car sharp. Despite the MC20's otherworldly performance, its ride is reasonably compliant with the adaptive suspension in its most comfortable mode; it soaks up bumps well enough to consider driving it daily or taking it on a road trip. Maserati also says an all-electric variant of the MC20 with all-wheel drive will hit the market in short order. The company hasn't released any details about the battery or electric motors yet, but we expect to hear more about the EV model soon. </p>

When the top is in place, its electrochromic glass panel can be changed from clear to opaque should the sun be shining a little too brightly. Maserati says the Cielo offers the same amount of passenger and cargo room as the Coupé model, but that only means that the cargo space is equally paltry. The convertible model will be offered with an optional and exclusive paint color—Acquamarina—which is available only on the Primaserie Launch Edition trim, of which only 60 will be built. </p>
